          <span>Biography</span>
          <p>
          Professor Toyohiko Yatagai received his B.Eng. degree in applied physics from University of Tokyo in 1969. He pursued his studies at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research from 1970 to 1983, and received his Ph.D. in engineering from University of Tokyo in 1980. Following Associate Professor in University of Tsukuba from 1983 to 1993, he was appointed Professor of applied physics in 1993. In 2007, he moved to Utsunomiya University and was appointed Distinguished Professor in 2012. He successively served as President of Optical society of Japan from 2009 to 2010, Vice-President of Japan Photonics Council from 2010 to date, and SPIE President in 2015.<br />
          <br />
          He started his research works on optical information processing and holography. An optical pattern recognition system using optical correlator was investigated based on statistical pattern classifier theory. Computer-generated holograms(CGHs) were investigated for 3-D display, in which a holographic stereogram was synthesized projected images of objects. Then he applied CGHs into interferometry to perform aspherical optical testing. Moire topographic systems have been developed for surface shape measurement, which was applied to screening scoliosis. Automatic interferometric fringe analysis systems have been developed using digital image processing technique. He initiated optical computing research in Japan. Cellular logic optical computing systems based on space-variant optical logic and optical neural network computing systems were developed. High speed interferometric fringe analysis systems based on spatial and temporal phase shifting algorithms have been developed, which were used semiconductor and LC industry. He is also active in organic optical materials, such as azo-benzene polymers, which were applied to polarization recording. Interferometric methods were applied to biological tomographic measurements; optical coherence tomography(OCT). Fourier-domain OCT was developed for retina imaging, which was commercialized for clinical application. From 2009, he is supervising a JST national project on vector wave holographic optical storage system, in which polarization holography is investigated.

          <p>
          Satoshi Kawata received his BSc, Msc, and PhD all in Applied Physics in 1974, 76, and 79, respectively, from Osaka University. After the experience of postdoctral fellow of JSPS, he spent two years in University of California, at Irvine as a Research Associate. He joined Osaka University as a faculty member in 1981 and was promoted to Professor of Applied Physics in 1993. He joined RIKEN as a Chief Scientist from 2002 to 2012 and as a Team Leader from 2012 to 2015.<br />
          <br />
          Professor Kawata is now the Distinguished Professor of Departments of Applied Physics and Frontier Bioscience at Osaka University, and a Honorary Scientist of RIKEN. He is currently the President of JSAP (Japan Society of Applied Physics), and has served as General Chair of SPIE Nano Science and Engineering. He is a Fellow of OSA, IOP, SPIE, and JSAP. <br />
          <br />
          He is one of the pioneers in near field optics (the inventor of tip-enhanced near-field microscopy), three-dimensional microscopy (laser CT microscopy, 3D data storage), plasmoics (SPR sensors, plasmon holography, plasmon laser, plasmonic microscopy), two-photon engineering (two-photon polymerization, two-photon isomerization, two-photon photorefraction, two-photon SPP, etc), bio-imaging, and signal recovery.<br />
          <br />
          He has authored/edited more than 30 books and published more than 400 papers with h-index 63, and was awarded the Medal with Purple Ribbon from the Emperor of Japan, Japan IBM Science Award, LVMH da Vinci Excellence, Shimadzu Award, and many others. The "8-micron bull" fabricated with his invented two-photon technology has been awarded in Guinness World Record Book 2004 Edition.
