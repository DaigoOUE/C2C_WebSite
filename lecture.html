          <span>Biography</span>
          <p>
          Professor Nicholas Isaac Smith received his bachelor's degree from University of Sydney in 1997, and He obtained Ph. D. in applied physics from Osaka University in 2002. Following assistant professor in Osaka University from 2003 to 2009, he was appointed Associate Professor at Immunology Frontier Research Center (iFreC) , Osaka University in 2010. <br />
          <br />
          His field of speciality is laser spectroscopy, and he is interested in interactions between laser beam and cells. He is active in study of mechanism of living cell with light or laser. Using light, he both observes and controls interactions between cells and physiological phenomenon, especially immune systems.
